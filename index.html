<div class="paragraph-text">
     <p>Just wanted to thank you for your help and understanding while I deal with stuff. These last few years have been the hardest of my life (so far), and I'm doing my best to not let it ruin my enjoyment of school. You've done a lot to mitigate that and I sincerely appreciate it.</p>
     <p>Please don't be offended that this thank you just happens to be in the form of my worst looking "site" to date. I'm not really looking for excuses, so I'll understand a stinky mark if you need to give me one. If you have some time and wouldn't mind, I'd like to sit down and get this sorted at some point because I can definitely see how it's beneficial. It almost feels like I'm regressing from last year (which really bothers me), but I'll try to keep up without burning out completely.</p>
